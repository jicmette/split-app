# Overview

As a developer, I'm always looking to expand my skills from the web to other platforms. This project represents my first step into mobile development, applying my existing knowledge of React to the React Native ecosystem.

This software is the foundational prototype for "Split," a personal finance app. It's a proactive budgeting tool that takes a user's salary, subtracts their fixed bills and savings goals, and then calculates a simple "Weekly Spending Allowance" to help them stay on track.

The purpose of this specific module was to build the core user interface and local functionality of the app. This included setting up the development environment, creating multiple screens (a Dashboard and an "Add Expense" form), implementing navigation between them using React Navigation, and using `AsyncStorage` to save the user's budget data locally on their device.
